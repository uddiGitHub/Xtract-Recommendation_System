# 🧠 Xtract Research Paper Recommendation System

> Empowering researchers with intelligent recommendations for relevant research papers.

---

## Overview

**Xtract** is a research paper recommendation system designed to assist students, researchers, and academicians in discovering relevant academic papers based on their interests, search queries, or reading history.

It leverages **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **transformer-based embeddings** to understand the semantic similarity between research papers — going beyond simple keyword matching to deliver context-aware recommendations.

## Key Features


- **Semantic Recommendations:** Finds research papers based on meaning, not just keywords.  
- **Powered by Transformer Models:** Tested with both **SciBERT** and **SBERT** models for high-quality contextual embeddings.  
- **Interactive Frontend:** Modern, responsive UI for searching and exploring papers.  
- **Deployed on Vercel:** Seamless cloud hosting for easy access and scalability.  
- **Notebook Support:** Jupyter notebooks for data preprocessing, embedding generation, and experiments.  
- **Modular Design:** Separate modules for backend, frontend, and notebook experimentation.
